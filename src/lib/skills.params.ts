			I have used it extensively in academic environments such as in CS1110 and CS4700 and CS4701 at Cornell University.
			Additionally, many of my passion projects involve heavy python usage. Click on any project below to find out more, Flare being my most
			elaborate python project thus far.`,

		description: `Rust has been my most recent endeavor. Appealing to me due to its amazing compiler and memory management, I have decided to pursue a 
			deep understanding of the language. Starting with my bf-Interpreter, I hope to add many more projects to this list and develop my
			backend development skills parallel with the good coding practices and memory efficiency that rust enforces.`,

		description: `Java was the very first language I learned back in high school. The object oriented paradigm served as a catalyst to propell me
			into studying CS at Cornell. I have used Java academically in AP CSA and CS2110 at Cornell University. Notably, in CS2110 I ranked
			12th out of ~630 students in our final project; learn more at the project McDiver.`,

		description: `My introduction to frontend development occurred during my Stanford Summer Session. I learned HTML/CSS and Javascript in CS106B, and have since
			put those practices into use in personal and academic project when needed. Though I have transitioned to typescript for some recent endeavors
			(including this website), I still have a strong grasp of Javascript and its frameworks (React, Node, etc.).`,

		description: `Since discovering React earlier in 2023, I have fallen in love with the possibilities it offers. I have used it heavily in the production of Flare,

			place in the annual AppDev hackathon for best backend. I have used it in conjunction with React to develop a good understanding of how to develop

		description: `Though a very broad skill to list, this year I have dove deep into the realm of machine learning. I have used it in my academic projects such as in 
			CS4700 and CS4701 (Foundations of Artificial Intelligence and Practicum of Artificial Intelligence respectively),as well as in my personal projects
			such as in my climate media validator. I have used it in conjunction with python and tensorflow to develop a good understanding of how to develop a
			machine learning model. Though I have limited project to show for this skill, I plan to concentrate in the Cornell Engineering Artifical Intelligence vector
			and hope to add more projects to this list soon, and potentially pursue a career in the field.`,

		description: `I was thrust into the world of functional programming throug CS3110 at Cornell University. Through that course, I have developed an OCaml interpreter, as well
			as a task manager terminal-based application. I heavily enjoy the security that functional programming offers, and since taking the course
			I have been inspired to learn about software outside of my previous imperative experience. OCaml has been a huge reason I have decided to learn Rust,
			as even though it is a general purpose language, it is heavily inspired by functional programming.`,
