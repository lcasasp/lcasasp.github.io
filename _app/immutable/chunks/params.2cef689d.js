			promote privacy. The idea of this app is to have Cornell students

			to view and message the ride host to form a deal and navigate 
			together. This saves costs for both parties involved. Using 
			Distance Matrix API, the distance was calculated for each ride, 
			and that can be used to calculate costs on front-end for each ride.
			

			Backend requirements: Using Flask, I have made a db file with 
			classes User, Ride, and Message in order to form an API that 
			uses many to many relationships to best gather all the data for 
			front-end. Additionally, googlemaps API's are used to calculate 
			distance among the destinations selected and thus giving front end
			space to handle cost estimates. I have fully deployed the server,

			OAuth because the server does not use a top level domain. However,
			if testing on a local url, the Oauth works perfectly and uses 
			organization only specifications to only allow cornell students 
			to add to database. In order to fix OAuth for the deployment stage,
			a top level domain would be needed for deployment to host the 
			server there instead, but for the scope of this project I felt
